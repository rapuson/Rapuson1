                        <h4>High School</h4>
                        <p>When I was in high school, it was the time when pandemic hits. I was grade 8 that time.
                            <br>I remember myself attending my class wearing pajamas while eating my breakfast
                            <br>to be honest, I lost my motivation that time to study that's why I dont have any achievements
                            <br>when I'm in 8th and 9th grade but when I am in 10th grade, I promise to myself that I will
                            <br>attend my moving up ceremony with honors and I did it!

                        <h4>Senior High School</h4>
                        <p>  I became a President of my section in grade 11 and 12, It was hard because I'm not good 
                            <br> at communicating plus I am an introvert type of person my I manage to handle my section very well. 
                            <br>In that two years in senior high, I realized that communicating is not really that hard and the only key
                            <br>is getting out of your comfort zone which I did but after what I've been through ever since I get out, 
                            <br>I came back on my comfort zone again. </p>
