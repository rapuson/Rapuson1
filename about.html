            <p>Hi! I am Alija Rein C. Rapuson from Quezon City. I want to share a little bit about myself 
                I was born in March 22, 2006 at Tanay, Rizal. I have 4 siblings and one of us is a boy.
                My favorite sports when I was a kid was track and field and badminton. I remember getting home 
                late because I spent playing around my school. My favorite subject back then was math and science
                when I entered senior high, my favorite subject was 21st Century Literature, Gen Math and Creative Writing.
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                I am quiet but observant, I love reading books that the genre are romance and sci-fi. I love coffee A LOT!! I also
                love spongebob squarepant so obviously my favorite color is yellow (and pink, viloet) I love listening to Cup of Joe,
                Over October and many more bands and soloist. Many people says that I am simple that's why I am very approachable.
                I have a problem in my eyes. I have a open angle glaucoma in my left eye, while my rigt eye is getting blurry.
                I undergo surgery last November and it affected my studies when I was senior high but I'm glad that I am one
                of those who graduated with honors.</p>
